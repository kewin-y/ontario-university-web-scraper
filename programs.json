    "Notes": "The Bachelor of Computer Science degree is a flexible program that lets you tailor your studies to different areas of specialization. Our BCOSC – Mobile Software Engineering enables you to apply the foundation skills of Computer Science to the development of applications and systems that implement the use of mobile devices in modern computer systems. This allows you to develop expertise in what is becoming a predominant part of the application of computer technology. You will study the range of applications of mobile devices and will learn to develop applications on a variety of mobile platforms. Graduates of this program will be able to apply the use of mobile devices in business, industry, social media and gaming. The specialization requires you to do at least 1 major project that can form the basis for a portfolio of skills, as you seek employment in the industry.",

Marie, followed by a seamless transition to the second year of Engineering at Laurentian University in Sudbury in either Mechanical, Chemical or Mining Engineering. Reactions, interactions and creation – the science and study behind the building blocks of life. Chemical Engineering students learn about organic and inorganic chemistry, statistics and chemical processes and reactions. They use creativity to solve issues related to process, design, to innovate products, research and manufacturing. Chemical Engineers work in a wide variety of roles such as civil service, process engineering, entrepreneurship, management, manufacturing, research and development, or move on to pursue graduate studies.",
